Lyte Wall Master
================

## Description

This is the master controller sketch for the Lyte Wall Project.

An array of 12 x 12 WS2812 LEDs (aka NeoPixels) have been affixed behind
a glass tile window at Site3 coLaboratory in Toronto.  The project has involved
many people from Site3 (please update the acknowledgements if you see anyone
missing).

A lot source code has been graciously provided by Klaas De Craemer, who built
an LED Table which was subsequently featured on HAD (hackaday.com):

## Acknowledgments

- **Klaas De Craemer**
  - (LED Table code - Tetris clone, Snake clone, Stars, Rainbow)
- **Marc Reeve-Newson**
  - Basically everything. From parts acquisition, to designing and building the frame, to soldering fiddly bits onto excruciatingly small printed circuit boards, and the agony of testing said assemblies.
- **Seth Hardy**
  - PCB layout for the WS2812 LED break-out boards, among endless other things (like cofounding Site3 and keeping it running for so many years).
