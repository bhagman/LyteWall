Lyte Wall Controller
====================

## Description

This is a display controller for a matrix of LEDs.  Specifically, a string
of WS2812 LEDs (aka NeoPixels).  The matrix can be redefined to any size.

The functions/methods are provided using a serial interface.  Initially,
only standard UART communications are being used, but we can extend the
interface use I2C and SPI eventually.

## Documentation

Eventually, documentation will be provided in the [documentation wiki](https://github.com/bhagman/LyteWallController/wiki) that accompanies this repository.
